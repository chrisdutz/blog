## Running my DELL XPS-17 9700 with Ubuntu 21.04

Even if I have been using Linux since 1999 or so, I wouldn't call me a "pro" on that. I'm more the Gui-centric person who likes to install pre-compiled stuff. So please excuse if this writeup might not be 100% correct. It's what I assumed to happen and be required. I'm happy for PRs if I'm wrong somewhere.

### Typical Problems

#### Choppy audio as soon as the Mic is being used

Obviously I had this problem before building my custom kernel.
As soon as any application started using any of the microphones, the audio-output instantly was choppy and un-understandable (Someone wrote Dalek-Like audio, which I think fits nicely).

I wanted to address this issue after enabling the general Audio support.
However, as soon as I booted with my custom kernel it seems this was no longer an issue. So please follow the next chapter on how to build your custom kernel.

#### No sound from the on-board audio

NOTE: Bluetooth audio seems to be working nicely

It seems that even if the Kernel starting with version 5.10 generally supports the on-board audio hardware used in my XPS-17 and Ubuntu 21.04 being based on 5.11, it should also support it.
Unfortunately according to this post (https://blog.fts.scot/2020/07/04/dell-xps-2020-how-to-get-audio-working-on-linux/#comment-356) it seems the Ubuntu folks configured the kernel wrong when they built it.

In general there are two settings that need changing:

    CONFIG_SND_SOC_INTEL_SOUNDWIRE_SOF_MACH=m
    CONFIG_SND_SOC_INTEL_USER_FRIENDLY_LONG_NAMES=y

Unfortunately, for this you need to build your own version of the Ubuntu kernel.

I followed the guide here (https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Kernel/BuildYourOwnKernel) for building, but it needed some adjustments.

1) Setup the build environment:

    sudo apt-get build-dep linux linux-image-$(uname -r)
    sudo apt-get install libncurses-dev gawk flex bison openssl libssl-dev dkms libelf-dev libudev-dev libpci-dev libiberty-dev autoconf

2) Get the sources

Change to a directory where you want to have the sources checked out and run:

    apt-get source linux-image-unsigned-$(uname -r)

3) Change the configuration to support DELL XPS-17s audio devices

Edit the following file `debian.master/config/amd64/config.common.amd64` by adding:

    CONFIG_SND_SOC_INTEL_SOUNDWIRE_SOF_MACH=m
    CONFIG_SND_SOC_INTEL_USER_FRIENDLY_LONG_NAMES=y

Also edit `debian.master/config/annotations`:

Change:

    CONFIG_SND_SOC_INTEL_USER_FRIENDLY_LONG_NAMES   policy<{'amd64': 'n'}>

To:

    CONFIG_SND_SOC_INTEL_USER_FRIENDLY_LONG_NAMES   policy<{'amd64': 'y'}>

4) Give the Kernel a new name

We could now directly build the new kernel, however wouldn't we be able to distinguish it from the original one, so we have to give it a new name.

Edit the file `debian.master/changelog`.
The first line looks like this:

    linux (5.11.0-16.16) hiruste; urgency=medium

Append something to the version (I changed it to):

    linux (5.11.0-16.16+audio) hiruste; urgency=medium

5) Make some scripts executable:

    chmod a+x debian/rules
    chmod a+x debian/scripts/*
    chmod a+x debian/scripts/misc/*

6) Update the config:

NOTE: Go through all variants with `Y`, or you'll get errors (In my case that was for `generic` and for `lowlatency`)

    LANG=C fakeroot debian/rules clean
    LANG=C fakeroot debian/rules editconfigs

For each config, just hit `Save` and then `Exit`.

7) Build the Kernel:

    LANG=C fakeroot debian/rules clean
    LANG=C fakeroot debian/rules binary-headers binary-generic binary-perarch

This will take a while now ...

8) Install the new kernel

    sudo dpkg -i linux-headers-5.11.0-16_5.11.0-16.17+audio_all.deb linux-headers-5.11.0-16-generic_5.11.0-16.17+audio_amd64.deb linux-image-unsigned-5.11.0-16-generic_5.11.0-16.17+audio_amd64.deb linux-modules-5.11.0-16-generic_5.11.0-16.17+audio_amd64.deb linux-modules-extra-5.11.0-16-generic_5.11.0-16.17+audio_amd64.deb linux-buildinfo-5.11.0-16-generic_5.11.0-16.17+audio_amd64.deb

NOTE: For some reason `dpkg` didn't want to let me install `linux-image-unsigned-5.11.0-16-generic_5.11.0-16.17+audio_amd64.deb` as it claimed that it was already installed. In this case I simply double clicked on the file and installed it via the Ubuntu gui installer.

9) Reboot

Reboot your system to make it use the new kernel.


#### Bluetooth Problems

Every now and then, none of my `Bluetooth` devices work.
If I open the `Bluetooth` settings, I either see `Bluetooth` enabled, but the panel beneath is still as if it's disabled.
Or the enabled
It seems there are two different cases when this happens and different resolution strategies:

1. `Bluetooth` is locked by `rfkill`

You can check this by running:

    rfkill

On the commandline. It will report for `WiFi` and `Bluetooth` if it's hard or soft locked:

    cdutz@ChrisXPS:~/Projects/Private$ rfkill
    ID TYPE      DEVICE      SOFT      HARD
     0 bluetooth hci0   entsperrt entsperrt
     1 wlan      phy0   entsperrt entsperrt

If you see that it's locked, you can unlock it via the following command:

    sudo rfkill unblock bluetooth

At least in the case I encountered this was enough to make Bluetooth work again.

2. `Bluetooth` is NOT locked by `rfkill`

In all the other cases, all I needed to do was run:

    sudo systemctl restart bluetooth
