# Success stories

Usually for a success story a user of something reports some cool facts around something. However, in case of Apache PLC4X not a single company was willing to do this. Generally it always boiled down to "politics".

I'm trying to write down what we have achieved in the past however I'm not allowed to go into details, and I'm not allowed to name the companies involved.

## Loading massive amounts of PLC data

A major manufacturer of things that you can see on our roads all over the planet contacted me after having read my first article on PLC4X that I got published in one a German tech magazine.

In this case a team from a major automation vendor was trying to implement a system that was able to read something round 2600 data-points from every S7 PLC every 2 seconds and pump this data into Apache Kafka. In total, we were talking about 26000 devices world-wide.

So far that team seems to have been trying to use OPC-UA to do this, however whenever they tried going beyond 200 data-points per 2 seconds, the S7 PLCs went into lockdown due to excessive processing time in the IO component. On the intermediate VM which was collecting the data using a OPC-UA client library and manually pumping that to Kafka the VM was at it's limit when processing 10 PLCs.

So with a team of 2 people for 3 days we came and tried out my brand-new PLC4X-Kafka-Connect adapter. We mainly needed time for configuring the 2600 data-point-addresses as well as a dynamic number of PLC connections.

Within this timeframe we were able to collect all data-points within 200ms without overloading the PLCs. Also were we able to process 600 PLCs on the same standard VM the OPC-UA variant was able to process 10. (We tried it with 200 and could see the VM running at a constant 30% load, which still left 10% for safety)

So not only didn't we achieve the goal the customer aimed at, we were able to do it a two-digit number of millions cheaper.

Calculation:

- An S7 supports OPC-UA but enabling that costs approx 400€ in licence costs per device
- The OPC-UA Driver they used cost approx. 4000€ per node
- For the client side: 26000 x 400€ = 10.400.000€
- For the server side: 26000 / 10 * 4000€ = 10.400.000€
- In total: 20.800.000€

Some things that we didn't even take into account in this calculation, was that only very new S7 devices supported OPC-UA. So in general a lot of devices would have had to be replaced, retrofitted or updated. And usually the hard- and software-costs for running 60 times more VMs is probably a bit more than nothing.

What our solution had as advantage on top of what the customer asked for: The Kafka Connect setup would have provided a fault-tolerant automatic failover without any configuration needed. If in the classical approach of the other team one VM goes down, all PLCs attached to that vm stop sending data.

In the end we were able to load 1200 times more data:
13 times more data-points in a 10th of the time while producing 1/20th of the cpu-load on the VMs.

## Secure data-acquisition in pharma-production

When it comes to pharmaceutical production, things tend to get a lot more complicated. Just as an example: If you want to sell your products to the US market, your production must apply to the FDA rules. These enforce some pretty strict rules for network security.

In one of our POCs our customer had the challenge of having a team of data scientists for optimizing things in the area of production at that company. The problem is, that data-scientists need data to do their thing.

As I mentioned getting data in FDA regulated production is tricky. So far there were two options:
1) Copying data onto a hard-drive and taking that data for a bike ride though the company
2) Installing a system of audited, validated and certified software.

I think we all agree 1) is sort of sub-ideal. Problem with option 2 is that there is only a limited number of products supporting this. Due to the extremely expensive process of having the software audited and certified the product is extremely expensive too. I was told a normal license of this cost 100.000€ per installation while allowing to provide 10.000 data-points. The main dilemma now was, that you need to optimize production quite a bit in order to get the 100.000€ back, which usually killed all innovation projects in this area.

So what we did: We implemented passive-mode divers. These are drivers that purely listen to network traffic and don't emit any traffic themselves.

We also setup something we called a "network-diode" in the lack of such a product existing before. This device ensures on a network level that not a single ethernet frame can be sent to the secure network.

With this I setup a little demo system on a Raspberry PI using InfluxDB and Grafana. That system worked without configuration and instantly started showing changes to the production network. It even showed changes faster than the DeltaV control-system console they used.

This brings me to another problem with the classical approach: This involved a chain of 5 different systems. So if on the outside someone needed a new parameter, 5 systems needed to be changed, tested, released. In the end data appeared on the outside with a significant delay of several minutes.

With our approach, all that was needed for making a new parameter available, was to change the control-system to log an additional parameter.
